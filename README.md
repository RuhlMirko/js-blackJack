# Liar's dice

## Rules
Each player shakes their cup that contains 5 dices.
Each player has to raise or call out a bet:
 - Raise: You can only bet a bigger rank or more dices of the same rank
 - Call out: If you think that the previous bet is false you call out to show the dices in the table

If all dices match or exceed the bet the caller loses a dice
If all dices fall short of the bet the betting player loses a dice

The game ends when only one player has dices in his hand
